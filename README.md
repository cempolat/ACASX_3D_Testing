Tesing ACAS XU algorithm with agent-based simulation and evolutionary search

This is the code for paper "On the Validation of a UAV Collision Avoidance System Developed by Model-Based Optimization: Challenges and a Tentative Partial Solution", and the code for Chapter 6 of the thesis.

To use the code, you need the following dependencies: ACASX_3D: https://github.com/superxueyizou/ACASX_3D; MASON: http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/, an agent-based simulation framework; ECJ:http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/, an evolutionary search system in Java.
